# Project Purpose
In this project I'm learning about all the concepts and advantages of NextJs. And also learning to develop a fullstack app on it. 

# What I learnt?
- NextJs is SEO friendly due to server side rendering
- NextJs is performance friendly as server compiles the rendering instead of local browser
- You can also do Client Side Rendering if your page contains interactions
- Routing is quite easy in NextJs, no external library is needed
- NextJS natively supports image downsizing which improves performance on slower networks.
- NextJS also supports lazy loading which impacts performance significantly.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
